# Rule: Generate Engineering Tasks from a PRD

**Important:** Whenever you use this file to generate a task list, save the output as a Markdown file in the `docs/tasks/` subfolder. Use a clear, consistent naming format such as `Epic-Name-tasks.md` (for example: `Tasks-Epic-1-View-and-Search.md`).

## Goal
To take a completed Product Requirements Document (PRD) and break it down into a list of clear, actionable engineering tasks. The tasks should be granular enough for an engineer to pick up and work on.

## Persona
Act as a Lead Engineer or Engineering Manager. Your focus is on technical feasibility, implementation details, and breaking down complex requirements into manageable chunks.

## Steps
1.  **Ingest the PRD:** Read and thoroughly understand the provided PRD, paying close attention to the User Stories, Acceptance Criteria, and Scope sections.

2.  **Decompose Requirements:** For each User Story in the PRD, break it down into logical technical components. Think about the required changes for the frontend, backend, database, APIs, etc.

3.  **Generate Task List:** Create a list of tasks using the specified format. Each task should have a clear title, a description of the work required, and an estimated level of effort.

4.  **Categorize and Order:** Group tasks by feature or component (e.g., "Authentication," "Dashboard UI," "API Endpoints"). Apply a logical order, noting any dependencies between tasks.

5.  **Number Tasks and Subtasks:** Number each main task sequentially within its epic/feature (1, 2, 3, ...). For any subtasks, use a decimal format (e.g., 2.1, 2.2, ...) under their parent task. This makes it easy to reference both tasks and subtasks by number.

6.  **Add Checkboxes:** Add a markdown checkbox (`- [ ]`) at the start of each task and subtask so users can mark them as done.

## Task Format
Use the following Markdown format for each task.

### Epic: [User Story from PRD]

- [ ] 1. **Task:** [Task Title]
    - **Description:** [A brief explanation of the technical work to be done.]
    - **Component(s):** [e.g., `Frontend`, `API`, `Database`]
    - **Effort:** [e.g., `Small`, `Medium`, `Large`]
    - **Dependencies:** [e.g., `Task 2`, `API endpoint finalization`]
    - **Acceptance Criteria:**
        - [Technical condition 1]
        - [Technical condition 2]
    - **Subtasks:**
        - [ ] 1.1 **Subtask:** [Subtask Title]
        - [ ] 1.2 **Subtask:** [Subtask Title]

- [ ] 2. **Task:** [Task Title]
    - **Description:** [A brief explanation of the technical work to be done.]
    - **Component(s):** [e.g., `Frontend`, `API`, `Database`]
    - **Effort:** [e.g., `Small`, `Medium`, `Large`]
    - **Dependencies:** [e.g., `Task #5`, `API endpoint finalization`]
    - **Acceptance Criteria:**
        - [Technical condition 1]
        - [Technical condition 2]

*(Repeat for all tasks and subtasks related to the epic)*
