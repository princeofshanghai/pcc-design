### 1. Background & Problem Statement

LinkedIn's Product Configuration Center (PCC) has successfully delivered a comprehensive read-only view of our product catalog, enabling business stakeholders to independently discover and understand our 500+ products and their configurations. However, the system still requires engineering intervention for fundamental business operations.

When Priya (Product Manager) wants to test quarterly billing for Premium Career, or when Anand (Pricing Manager) needs to add a new market configuration, they must:
- File engineering tickets for simple business decisions
- Wait for development cycles and deployment windows
- Coordinate across multiple teams for what should be self-service operations

This creates bottlenecks that slow our ability to respond to market opportunities and conduct timely experiments. The quarterly billing scenario exemplifies this problem: a straightforward business decision (testing a new billing frequency) becomes a multi-week engineering project.

Epic 4 addresses this by enabling business users to independently create new product configurations, transforming PCC from a read-only reference into an operational business tool.

### 2. Goals & Success Metrics

The primary goal of this epic is to **enable business users to independently add new product configurations without engineering support.**

**Success Metrics:**
- **Self-Service Achievement:** Product Managers can add new configurations (like quarterly billing) in under 5 minutes without engineering involvement.
- **Request Reduction:** 80% reduction in "configuration change" engineering requests within 30 days of launch.
- **Time-to-Market:** Time from business decision to live configuration reduced from weeks to days.
- **User Adoption:** 90% of target users (PMs, Pricing Managers) successfully complete the "Add Configuration" workflow within their first attempt.

### 3. User Personas

- **Priya, the Product Manager:** Wants to test quarterly billing for Premium Career to improve conversion rates and reduce customer acquisition costs.
- **Anand, the Pricing Manager:** Needs to quickly add competitive pricing for new market configurations and billing cycles.
- **Sam, the Business Partner:** Needs to understand what new configurations will be available and when they'll go live.

### 4. User Stories & Acceptance Criteria

**User Story 1: Add New Product Configuration**
*As Priya the Product Manager, I want to add a quarterly billing option to my product, so that I can test if quarterly billing converts better than annual subscriptions.*

- **AC1:** From the Product Detail page's Pricing tab, I can click an "Add Configuration" button that opens a configuration creation workflow.
- **AC2:** I can select from dropdown menus for Channel (Desktop, Mobile, Field) and Billing Cycle (Monthly, Quarterly, Annual).
- **AC3:** I can set pricing for the new configuration in USD. The system acknowledges that multi-currency pricing (50+ currencies) will be supported in future iterations, but this epic focuses on USD as the primary currency to establish the core workflow.
- **AC4:** The system shows me a preview of the SKU that will be created, including the generated SKU ID and all inherited attributes.
- **AC5:** I can submit the configuration, which enters it into a change request workflow for review and deployment.

**User Story 2: Experiment with New Configurations**
*As Priya, I want to test my quarterly billing with a subset of users before full launch, so I can validate the business case without affecting all customers.*

- **AC1:** When creating a new configuration, I can optionally add a LIX Key and Treatment to make it experimental.
- **AC2:** The system clearly explains that experimental configurations will be managed through TREX for traffic control.
- **AC3:** I can preview how the experimental configuration will appear to users and understand the experiment workflow.
- **AC4:** Experimental configurations are visually distinguished in the SKU table with appropriate badges or styling.

**User Story 3: Understand Configuration Impact**
*As Anand the Pricing Manager, I want to see how new configurations fit into our overall pricing strategy, so I can ensure consistency and avoid conflicts.*

- **AC1:** The preview shows me how the new configuration relates to existing price groups and SKUs.
- **AC2:** I can see if the new configuration creates a new price group or uses an existing one.
- **AC3:** The system warns me of any potential pricing conflicts or inconsistencies before submission.
- **AC4:** After creation, I can view all SKUs that share the same price group from the configuration's detail view.

**User Story 4: Track Configuration Changes**
*As Sam the Business Partner, I want to understand what configurations are in progress, so I can communicate timelines and availability to stakeholders.*

- **AC1:** I can see the status of submitted configurations (e.g., "Pending Review," "In Staging," "Live").
- **AC2:** Each configuration change shows expected timeline and current stage in the deployment process.
- **AC3:** I can view a history of recent configuration changes for any product.
- **AC4:** The system provides shareable links to configuration change requests for cross-team communication.

### 5. Scope and Data Requirements

#### In Scope:
- **"Add Configuration" workflow** for existing products, enabling creation of new channel/billing combinations.
- **Price group creation and assignment** with automatic SKU generation based on configuration choices.
- **Basic change request workflow** (create → preview → submit → deploy) with status tracking.
- **LIX integration** for experimental configurations, allowing subset testing before full launch.
- **USD pricing support** as the primary currency for the MVP.
- **Configuration preview** showing users exactly what will be created before submission.

#### Out of Scope (for Epic 4):
- **Editing existing SKUs** (maintaining immutable SKU pattern for audit trail integrity).
- **Complex approval workflows** beyond basic review and deployment stages.
- **Multi-currency pricing** (future epic will expand beyond USD).
- **Bulk configuration operations** (adding multiple configurations simultaneously).
- **Product creation** (Epic 4 focuses on configuring existing products only).
- **Price group editing** (changing existing price points vs creating new configurations).

#### Data Requirements:
| Attribute | Level | Description / Example |
|---|---|---|
| Configuration ID | Configuration | Unique identifier for the configuration creation request |
| Target Product ID | Configuration | The product being configured |
| Sales Channel | Configuration | Desktop, Mobile, Field |
| Billing Cycle | Configuration | Monthly, Quarterly, Annual |
| Price Amount | Configuration | USD price for the new configuration |
| LIX Key | Configuration | Optional experiment identifier |
| LIX Treatment | Configuration | Optional experiment treatment name |
| Request Status | Configuration | Pending Review, In Staging, Live, Failed |
| Created By | Configuration | User who initiated the configuration |
| Created Date | Configuration | When the configuration was submitted |
| SKU ID | Generated | Auto-generated SKU identifier for the new configuration |
| Price Group ID | Generated | Auto-generated or existing price group identifier |

### 6. Open Questions & Design Considerations

- **Q1:** How do we display the audit trail of SKU creation and configuration changes? Should this be integrated into the existing SKU table, shown in a dedicated Activity tab, or linked to change request tracking?
- **Q2:** What constitutes the minimal viable change request workflow? Should we implement simple approval gates or start with immediate deployment to staging?
- **Q3:** How do we handle pricing validation and business rules? Should users have complete freedom in pricing or should the system enforce guidelines?
- **Q4:** What's the optimal UX for multi-currency pricing? When expanding from USD to 50+ currencies, should users see all currencies at once, have smart defaults based on existing product coverage, or use a "primary + add more" pattern?
- **Q5:** How should experimental configurations be visually distinguished in the SKU table and product views to avoid confusion?
- **Q6:** What's the appropriate level of preview detail? Should users see all generated attributes or just the key configuration elements?
- **Q7:** How do we handle configuration conflicts (e.g., trying to create a configuration that already exists)?

### 7. Glossary

- **Configuration:** A unique combination of Channel and Billing Cycle that defines how a product can be sold.
- **Configuration Request:** A user-initiated request to add a new configuration to an existing product.
- **Price Group:** A versioned container that holds pricing information and can be shared across multiple SKUs.
- **Change Request:** The workflow process that takes a configuration from creation to live deployment.
- **LIX Integration:** The connection to LinkedIn's experimentation framework (TREX) for testing configurations with user subsets.
- **Immutable SKU Pattern:** The design principle that existing SKUs are never modified; instead, new SKUs are created to preserve audit trails.
