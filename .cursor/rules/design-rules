# Shadcn/ui Aesthetic with Ant Design Implementation

## Visual Design Rule
- Use **Ant Design components and implementation patterns** exclusively
- Apply **Shadcn/ui visual characteristics** through Ant Design's theming system:
  - **Holistic Theming:** The entire Ant Design color system (primary, semantic, text, borders, backgrounds) should be mapped to the chosen Shadcn/ui theme palette (e.g., "Blue") to ensure global consistency.
  - **Flat design**: Avoid card containers, content should feel directly on the page
  - **Minimal borders**: Subtle, light borders (#e2e8f0) instead of heavy card shadows
  - **Neutral color palette**: Grays and whites with strategic accent colors from the theme palette.
  - **Generous whitespace**: More breathing room between elements
  - **Subtle shadows**: Soft, layered depth without heavy drop shadows
  - **Clean typography**: Careful font weights and spacing
  - **Rounded corners**: Consistent 6-8px border radius
  - **Smooth interactions**: Gentle hover states and transitions
- **Enterprise context**: Modern, professional look for LinkedIn internal tools
- **No custom CSS frameworks** - everything through Ant Design's built-in theming

## Implementation Guidelines
- Leverage Ant Design's `ConfigProvider` with custom `token` overrides
- Use Ant Design's built-in `style` and `className` props for component-level styling
- Apply consistent spacing and layout patterns through Ant Design's design system
- Maintain Ant Design's accessibility and component behavior
- Focus on flat, minimal layouts that feel modern and uncluttered
