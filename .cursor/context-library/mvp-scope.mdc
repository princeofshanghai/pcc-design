# PCC MVP Scope

## Goal of the MVP

The MVP will validate that we can provide a centralized, easy-to-navigate view of LinkedIn's product catalog and allow business stakeholders to independently design basic pricing experiments — reducing reliance on engineering and accelerating go-to-market speed.

---

## Primary User Journeys (Epics)

### 1. View and Search the Product Catalog

Users can browse, search, and filter LinkedIn's product catalog to find specific products, SKUs, prices, and market availability. The goal is to give PMs, pricing managers, and business partners a clear view of what LinkedIn offers — without having to ask engineers or dig through spreadsheets.

### 2. Design a New Pricing Experiment

Users can propose a new pricing experiment for an existing SKU. This action will create a new "experimental" SKU by cloning the original, allowing the user to define a new set of price points for it. The goal is to make it easy for business users to draft and test pricing changes without needing to understand the underlying SKU creation process or involve engineering.

---

## What's Explicitly Out of Scope

- Creating new products or complex SKUs from a blank slate. (The MVP only supports creating experimental SKUs by cloning an existing one via the guided pricing experiment workflow.)
- Bundling, offer creation, or discount logic  
- Editing existing product metadata (other than price, as part of an experiment)
- Backend integrations, authentication, or approval workflows (all experiments will be `Draft` only)
- Viewing analytics or experiment results  

This MVP is focused solely on viewing product data and drafting new pricing experiments.

---

## Success Metrics

- At least 80% of PMs and pricing managers are able to use PCC to look up product information without engineering support
- At least 3 pricing experiments are created by non-technical users within the first month
- Stakeholders report that the system is intuitive, faster, and reduces GTM bottlenecks
