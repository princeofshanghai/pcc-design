I want you to act like an expert software engineer doing a careful refactor of this codebase. Think step by step, and look for opportunities to clean up the project without breaking anything.

Be cautious and thorough. Assume I'm not technical, so explain what you’re doing in plain language. Focus on things like:

Removing unused code, files, components, variables, or imports

Identifying duplicate logic or unnecessary complexity

Improving naming for clarity

Splitting large files if they’re doing too much

Spotting dead or unreachable code

Helping organize the folder structure if it’s messy

Suggesting better patterns if something is fragile or hard to scale

Don't just make changes—first explain what you want to do and why, then go step by step. You can also ask me questions if something is unclear.

Think like a real engineer doing a code review before a big cleanup.
