# Status & Lifecycle Model

---

## 1. Business Status

Tracks whether a Product, SKU, or Price is actively offered.

- **Active** – Currently in use
- **Legacy** – No longer offered to new users, but still in use
- **Retired** – Fully deprecated and unused

### Status Cascade

Status flows upward from Price Point → Price → SKU → Product:

- If any Price Point is Active → Price is Active
- If any Price is Active → SKU is Active
- If any SKU is Active → Product is Active

> Example:  
> - A `Monthly, NAMER, Desktop` SKU has a Price with a single active USD Price Point → the entire SKU and Product are considered Active.

---

## 2. Publishing Status (Lifecycle State)

Tracks where a change is in the deployment workflow. This is separate from business status.

- **Draft** - Being edited
- **Pending to EI** - Awaiting engineering staging
- **EI** - In Enterprise Infrastructure staging
- **Pending to Prod** - Passed EI, queued for production
- **Prod** - Fully live

Only **Prod** entities affect real users.

> Note: In MVP (Epic 1), users only view live Prod data. Lifecycle tracking becomes critical in Epic 2 (editing workflows).

## 3. Business vs. Publishing Status

| Level              | Business Status        | Publishing Status         |
|--------------------|------------------------|----------------------------|
| **Product**        | Active, Legacy, Retired| Draft → EI → Prod          |
| **SKU**            | Same as above          | Same                       |
| **Price Group**    | Same                   | Same                       |
| **Price Point**    | Same                   | Same                       |

- Both statuses should be independently displayed.
- Lifecycle helps track proposed vs. live changes.
- Business status reflects customer-facing availability.

## 4. Summary

- **Business Status** = what is live/offered
- **Publishing Status** = where a change is in the deployment pipeline
- Lifecycle tracking will power future edit flows, CR dashboards, and safety reviews
