# Experimentation Model: Validity & LIX Logic

---

## 1. LIX: Experimentation at the SKU Level

All experimentation in PCC is handled at the **SKU level**.

A SKU represents a stable, immutable configuration. To test changes (e.g., new billing cycle, price, digital goods, or description), we create a **new SKU** and assign it to a LIX experiment.

- **Lix Key**: Experiment identifier (e.g., `sku_quarterly_billing_2025`)
- **Lix Treatment**: User group bucket (e.g., `control`, `variantA`)

Only users bucketed into the treatment will see the new SKU. If no LIX is set, the SKU is generally visible.

✅ Example: To enable quarterly billing for a product (you are enabling quarterly billing for the product, and thus creating a new SKU), create a new SKU with quarterly billing, new price group, and LIX assignment. The entire configuration (description, pricing, digital goods) is versioned and tested as a unit.

## 2. Validity Periods

While LIX controls **who** sees a SKU, **Validity Periods** control **when** its prices apply.

Every **Price Group** tied to a SKU can have:
- **Valid From**: When pricing becomes active
- **Valid To**: When it ends (optional)

If left blank:
- Valid From defaults to the moment the Price Group is pushed to production
- Valid To remains open-ended

**Price Points** (per currency) inherit the validity periods from the Price Group but can override them (e.g., adding EUR pricing later).

## 3. Combined Logic

| Condition                      | Result                                      |
|-------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| SKU has no LIX                | Shown to all users once prices are valid   |
| SKU has LIX only              | Shown only to treatment group users         |
| SKU has LIX + validity dates  | Shown only to treatment group after date    |
| SKU with expired price group  | Not shown regardless of LIX                 |

## 4. Why SKU-Level LIX?

- **Atomic experiments**: Bundle changes to name, price, entitlements, and attributes
- **Safe rollouts**: Legacy SKUs remain untouched
- **Easy rollback**: Just unassign LIX or retire the test SKU
- **Minimal engineering dependency**

---

## 5. Summary

- **LIX = who** sees a SKU
- **Validity Periods = when** its pricing is valid
- **SKU = unit of experimentation**

Every change—price, billing cycle, digital good, or description—is modeled as a new SKU gated by a LIX experiment.
