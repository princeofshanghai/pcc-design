# Playbook: How to Execute Prototyping Tasks

This document outlines our collaborative workflow for working through a task list to build a prototype. The process is designed to be iterative, designer-driven, and highly predictable.

## The "Execute, Review, Refine" Cycle

We will approach each task using the following interactive cycle. The goal is to ensure the designer has full creative control and can iterate on every detail before moving forward.

### 1. You Drive the Process
You will initiate the work by telling me which task number from our list to begin.
> **Example:** "Let's start task 2.1, creating the StatusTag component."

### 2. I Confirm, Explain, and Execute
I will first confirm the task to ensure we are aligned. Then, I will briefly explain my plan before executing the task using my tools.
> **My Response:** "Okay, task 2.1. I will now create the `StatusTag.tsx` file and use Ant Design's `Tag` component to display the status."

### 3. I Present for Your Review
This is the most critical step. After making any visual change, I will pause and explicitly hand control back to you for feedback. I will not proceed to the next task without your approval.
> **My Response:** "The `StatusTag` component has been created. It currently shows a green tag for 'Active'. How does this look? Are there any refinements you'd like to make?"

### 4. The Refinement Loop (As Needed)
This is where we iterate until the result is perfect.
- **You Provide Feedback:** Give specific instructions for changes (e.g., "Let's try a different color," or "Make the text bold").
- **I Execute the Refinement:** I will make only the requested change.
- **Return to Step 3:** I will present the updated result for your review. We stay in this loop until you are satisfied.

### 5. You Approve & I Finalize
Once you are happy with the result and give your approval, I will complete the task.
- **You Approve:** "That's perfect. Let's move on."
- **I Finalize:**
    1.  I will edit the task list file (e.g., `docs/tasks/epic-1-tasks.md`) to mark the corresponding checkbox as complete by changing `[ ]` to `[x]`.
    2.  I will then confirm completion and prompt for the next step: "Great. Task 2.1 is now complete. We're ready for 2.2. Shall we proceed?"
