# Shadcn/ui + Geist/Vercel Aesthetic with Ant Design Implementation

## Visual Design Rules
- Use **Ant Design components and implementation patterns** exclusively.
- Apply **Shadcn/ui and Geist/Vercel visual characteristics** through Ant Design's global theming system:
  - **Holistic Theming:** All Ant Design color and typography tokens (primary, semantic, text, borders, backgrounds, font sizes, weights, line heights) are mapped to a custom theme in `src/theme.ts` for global consistency.
  - **Typography:** Font sizes, weights, and line heights follow the Geist/Vercel scale for a modern, compact, and elegant look. Font family is Inter, with system sans-serif fallback.
  - **Flat design:** Avoid card containers; content should feel directly on the page.
  - **Minimal borders:** Subtle, light borders (#e2e8f0) instead of heavy card shadows.
  - **Neutral color palette:** Grays and whites with strategic accent colors from the theme palette.
  - **Generous whitespace:** More breathing room between elements.
  - **Subtle shadows:** Soft, layered depth without heavy drop shadows.
  - **Rounded corners:** Consistent 6-8px border radius.
  - **Smooth interactions:** Gentle hover states and transitions.
  - **Compact menus:** Sidebar and menu font sizes use the compact Geist/Vercel scale (14px).
- **Enterprise context:** Modern, professional look for LinkedIn internal tools.
- **No custom CSS frameworks**—everything through Ant Design's built-in theming and tokens.

## Implementation Guidelines
- Define and maintain the global theme in `src/theme.ts`.
- Wrap the entire app in Ant Design's `ConfigProvider` with the custom theme in `App.tsx`.
- Use Ant Design's built-in `style` and `className` props for component-level styling, but rely on tokens for global consistency.
- Apply consistent spacing and layout patterns through Ant Design's design system.
- Maintain Ant Design's accessibility and component behavior.
- Focus on flat, minimal layouts that feel modern and uncluttered.
- All new pages and components automatically inherit the global theme and tokens.
