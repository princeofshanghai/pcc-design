# Product Model: Catalog Structure & Core Entities

---

## 1. Catalog Organization

### 1.1 Line of Business (LOB)
LinkedIn groups all products into one of four LOBs:
- **LTS** – Talent Solutions
- **LMS** – Marketing Solutions
- **LSS** – Sales Solutions
- **Premium** – Subscriptions for individuals & small businesses

Each product belongs to one LOB. LOB is used in navigation, filtering, reporting, and access control.

### 1.2 Product Category
Categories are sub-groupings within a LOB. Each product has one category. Examples:

- **LTS:** Career Pages, Glint, Learning, SMB Solution
- **LSS:** Sales Navigator
- **LMS:** Ads
- **Premium:** Multiseat, Small Business, Company Page

### 1.3 Product ID
A permanent, unique ID (e.g., `5095295`) used for lookup and reference across LinkedIn systems.

## 2. Core Entity Hierarchy

Product
└── SKU (e.g., Standard Version: Annual, NAMER, Desktop)
    └── Price (Standard Price, effective all year)
        ├── Price Point (USD 240.00)
        └── Price Point (CAD 320.00)

### 2.1 Product
Conceptual offering users recognize, e.g., “Sales Navigator Core”. Acts as a container for all SKUs.

### 2.2 SKU (Sellable Configuration)
A unique combo of attributes like Channel, Region, and Billing Cycle. SKUs are **immutable** and the unit of experimentation.

- To test new configs (e.g., pricing), create a new SKU and gate with a LIX key.
- Example: Annual / NAMER / Desktop SKU.

### 2.3 Price
Tied to a specific SKU, defines when certain prices are valid. Includes:
- **Effective Dates** (Start, End)
- **Drafts & Publishing workflow**

Used for scheduled pricing (e.g., Q4 promotion).

### 2.4 Price Point
The actual currency value (e.g., USD 999.99). Multiple price points live under a single Price object, one per currency.

## Notes
- A single Product may have many SKUs.
- Each SKU has one or more Price versions.
- Each Price holds multiple currency-specific Price Points.
- SKUs are never edited—new versions are created to support safe experimentation.
