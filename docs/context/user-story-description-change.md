# User story - Name and description update

## Persona

Tiffany, a senior PM on the LinkedIn Learning team, is leading a rebranding effort to rename and update the public names and descriptions of two SKUs — Base to Learning and Hub to Career Hub. She wants to roll out these changes with confidence that it will be on time, without depending on engineering or navigating an unclear approval process.

## Concept

Tiffany opens the Product Configuration Center (PCC) and quickly locates the products she needs to update, using the intuitive folder navigation UI that reflects her team’s mental model. She updates the names and descriptions, then saves her changes.

PCC prompts her to either create a new Go-to-Market (GTM) Motion or add the updates to an existing one. She sets an activation date, knowing the GTM Motion will remain in draft until she’s ready to launch. While in draft, she can keep adding changes, see exactly who needs to approve them, and view the full timeline.

Once ready, Tiffany submits the GTM Motion. PCC automatically sends the updates to EI, routes them to the right stakeholders for approval, and keeps her informed with email notifications at each stage (Draft → Pushing to EI → In EI → Approvals Sent → Approvals Received → Pushing to Prod → Live).

## Goals

By using PCC, Tiffany avoids office hour bottlenecks, no longer hunts down approvers manually, and doesn’t rely on engineering to execute. She launches faster, with more confidence— spending more time on strategy and less time on process.

## Root JTBD

Launch product updates quickly and confidently — without managing internal complexity.

## UXR Insight

PMs feel blocked by low visibility, confusing workflows, and brittle spreadsheet uploads. Clear UI guidance helps them move faster with confidence.
