# PCC MVP Scope

## Goal of the MVP

The MVP for the Product Configuration Center (PCC) is to deliver a foundational platform that solves our most immediate challenges while paving a clear path toward our long-term vision. The goal is to incrementally deliver value by first establishing a single source of truth for our product catalog, then enabling basic edits, and finally providing a framework for GTM experimentation.

This phased approach will validate our core hypotheses: that we can empower business users to self-serve, reduce dependency on engineering, and accelerate go-to-market speed.

## MVP Epics

The MVP will be built in three logical, sequential epics. Each epic delivers a standalone piece of value and serves as a building block for the next.

### Epic 1: The Single Source of Truth (Read-Only)

*   **Goal:** Create a centralized, searchable, and trustworthy "read-only" view of the entire product catalog.
*   **Why it's first:** Before we can edit or experiment, we must first be able to *see* what we have. This epic solves the immediate and painful problem of data fragmentation. It provides immense value on its own by giving all stakeholders—PMs, Pricing, Sales—a single place to get answers, replacing the current system of spreadsheets and ad-hoc engineering queries.
*   **Key Outcomes:** A web app where users can search and filter to find any product or SKU and see its details, prices, and configurations. This is our foundation.

### Epic 2: Foundational Product Editing

*   **Goal:** Enable trusted users to perform basic edits on existing products and SKUs.
*   **Why it's second:** Once we have a reliable view of the catalog, the next logical step is to allow for simple changes. This directly tackles the "dependency on engineering for minor updates" problem from our vision. This could include changing a product's name, updating its description, or deactivating a legacy SKU. It introduces the complexity of write operations in a controlled, auditable manner.
*   **Key Outcomes:** A simple, form-based interface for editing key attributes of an existing product or SKU. This will require basic audit logging (i.e., tracking who changed what and when).

### Epic 3: Designing & Managing GTM Experiments

*   **Goal:** Build a dedicated, guided workflow for designing and managing experiments for pricing, billing, and other GTM levers.
*   **Why it's third:** Experimentation is complex. It requires cloning existing entities, creating variants, and managing their lifecycle (draft, active, completed). By building this on top of our established "read" (Epic 1) and "edit" (Epic 2) capabilities, the engineering work becomes much simpler and more focused. We are not trying to solve for viewing, editing, and experimenting all at once.
*   **Key Outcomes:** A guided flow where a user can select a SKU, define the changes they want to test (e.g., new price, annual billing option), and save it as a "draft" experiment. This isolates experimental models from the core product catalog.

## What's Explicitly Out of Scope for the MVP

*   **Complex SKU Creation:** Creating net-new products or complex SKUs from scratch.
*   **Advanced Logic:** Bundling, automated discount/offer creation, or complex entitlement logic.
*   **Live Experimentation Engine:** The MVP focuses on *designing* experiments (saving as drafts). It will not include the infrastructure to push experiments live, serve traffic to them, or measure results.
*   **Full-Fledged CMS:** This is not a replacement for a content management system for marketing assets.
*   **Approval Workflows & Integrations:** No integrations with other systems or formal approval chains will be built in the MVP.

---

## Success Metrics for the Overall MVP

*   **Epic 1 Adoption:** 80% of target users can independently look up product information without engineering support within one month of launch.
*   **Epic 2 Efficiency:** A measurable reduction in ad-hoc requests to engineering for simple text or status changes.
*   **Epic 3 Enablement:** At least 3 GTM experiments are fully designed (as drafts) by business users within one month of the final epic's launch.
*   **Overall User Satisfaction:** Stakeholders report that PCC is intuitive, trustworthy, and a significant improvement over the old process.
