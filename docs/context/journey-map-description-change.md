# Journey map - Name and description change 

## 1. Navigate to the Right Products  
Tiffany opens **PCC** and uses the folder navigation — organized around her team’s mental model — to quickly locate the products she needs (**LinkedIn Learning Base** and **LinkedIn Learning Hub**).  

## 2. Update Name and Description  
From the product detail view, Tiffany edits each product’s **public name** and **description**.  

## 3. Save and Create GTM Motion  
When she saves, PCC prompts her to either **create a new Go-to-Market (GTM) Motion** or **add the updates to an existing one**.  
She chooses to create a new GTM Motion and sets an **activation date** — determining when the updates will go live.  
The motion is created in **Draft** state.  

## 4. Review Motion Overview  
Tiffany lands on the GTM Motion detail page, where she sees upfront:  
- A **visual timeline** of all motion stages (Draft → Pushing to EI → In EI → Approvals → Pushing to Production → Live)  
- The **actual stakeholders** who need to approve, along with their names and team affiliations  
- A **change list** showing the affected SKUs and exactly what will be updated  
This gives her full visibility into the process before submitting.  

## 5. Submit Motion  
Confident in her changes, Tiffany clicks **Submit** from the GTM Motion detail page.  

## 6. Approvals Triggered  
PCC pushes the motion to **EI** and automatically routes approval requests to the identified stakeholders.  
Approvers receive an **email notification** with a button linking directly to the GTM Motion detail page in PCC.  
This page opens in a **simplified approval mode**, where approvers can:  
- Approve the motion  
- Leave comments or questions  
- Reject the motion with feedback  

## 7. Go Live  
Once all approvals are received, the motion moves through **Pushing to Production** and reaches the **Live** state.  
Tiffany receives a confirmation email and can see the updated names and descriptions reflected in production.
